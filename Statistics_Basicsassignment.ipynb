        "The normal distribution, also known as the bell curve, is a fundamental concept in statistics. Here are its key properties:  \n",
        "\n",
        "Symmetry:\n",
        "\n",
        " The curve is perfectly symmetrical around the mean. This means half the data falls below the mean, and the other half falls above it.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Normal distribution curve\n",
        "\n",
        "Unimodal: The curve has a single peak, which corresponds to the mean, median, and mode of the distribution. In a normal distribution, these three measures of central tendency are all equal.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Bell-shaped: The curve resembles a bell, with the highest point at the mean and gradually tapering off on both sides.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Standard Deviation: The spread of the data is determined by the standard deviation (σ). A larger standard deviation indicates a wider, flatter curve, while a smaller standard deviation results in a narrower, taller curve.  \n",

        "The Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)\n",
        "\n",
        "The empirical rule, also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule, is a handy tool for understanding how data is distributed in a normal distribution. It states:  \n",
        "\n",
        "68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. This means that approximately 68% of the data points lie between (mean - σ) and (mean + σ).  \n",
        "95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean. About 95% of the data points are between (mean - 2σ) and (mean + 2σ).  \n",
        "99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean. Nearly all the data (99.7%) lies between (mean - 3σ) and (mean + 3σ).  \n",

        "Empirical rule on a normal distribution curve\n",

        "\n",
        "Natural Occurrence: Many natural phenomena follow a normal distribution, such as height, weight, IQ scores, and measurement errors.  \n",
        "Central Limit Theorem: The central limit theorem states that the distribution of sample means tends to be normal, regardless of the underlying population distribution, as the sample size increases. This makes the normal distribution crucial for statistical inference.  \n",
        "Standardization: The normal distribution allows us to standardize data using z-scores, which makes it easier to compare and analyze data from different distributions.  \n"
